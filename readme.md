[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/91d81612df574263b9f06c8c6c3e54ea)](https://www.codacy.com/app/danieljpeck93/Toolbox?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CachedNerds/Toolbox&utm_campaign=badger)

A collection of helper tools developed and used by Cached Nerds

### Requirements
 * **C++1z**: Write cool code.
 * **Boost 1.64.0**: Boot.Test and others. May update version frequently.
 * **make**: May change build system soon. 

 Compiles with GCC on linux, Clang and GCC on MacOS, and Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10. Recommend GCC or Clang for consistency. 

### Building the Toolbox
Each language type will have a _building.md_ file which explains how to build the Toolbox and the motivations for why we chose the build system we did.
