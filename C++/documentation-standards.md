# Documentation Standards
The Toolbox will be using Doxygen to generate all of the source code documentation.  This can be accomplished by running the command: ```doxygen Doxyfile``` in the C++ directory.

## Doxygen
1. All classes, functions/methods, namespaces, etc. if documented will be documented using the following comment syntax:
```
/**
 * Class Name
 *
 * A description of the class.
 */
```
