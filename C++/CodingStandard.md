# Toolbox C++ Coding Standard

A few rules to follow while developing with C++17.
## Control Flow
  - 1. There will be a space before an if/for condition.
    ```
    if (condition)
    {

    }
    ```
    ```
    for (condition)
    {

    }
    ```
    ```
    while (condition)
    {

    }
    ```
    ```
    do
    {

    } while (condition);
    ```

  - 2. Empty brackets shall contain a single empty line between them
    ```
    if (condition)
    {

    }
    ```
