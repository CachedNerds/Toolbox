## Guide to Contributing to the Toolbox

### ZenHub

The software lifecycle in Toolbox is tracked using an external tool that sits on top of GitHub called ZenHub. ZenHub can be used from the [webapp](app.zenhub.com) or the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US). 

ZenHub adds swim-lane boards which are used to organize issues. GitHub labels help organize issues in the swim-lanes and are required.  

ZenHub also adds Milestones and Epics. Milestones are used for releases or features. Epics track larger development efforts which may span multiple releases.

ZenHub is highly suggested for contributors because it allows one to see more information about issues, milestones, and epics that are not avaialble in vanilla-GitHub.
